# Deskpose

**WORK IN PROGRESS, STILL EXPERIMENTAL, NO DOCUMENTATION AT ALL**

Deskpose is a traditionally-designed desktop-oriented set of turn-key components
ready for use with Jetbrains (or Jetpack) Compose projects. It would make it
fairly trivial to build desktop apps that do not look alien on modern computers
at all.
